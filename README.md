# What is this?

This is the source code for various AO3 scripts that I have written.

# How do I use these?

First, you will need to install  the browser extension [Tampermonkey](https://www.tampermonkey.net/index.php), or something similar.
Then, you can install the scripts list on [my GreaseFork account](https://greasyfork.org/en/users/1281850-forceofcalm) by going to the script you want and clicking "install".

# I need help!

Feel free to message me on Discord at @forceofcalm if you need assistance beyond what is listed here.
